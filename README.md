# Deep Learning tutorial

This is repo for totebook and reminder for my learning curve of Coursera specialization ['Deep learning'] (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning? "Deep learning").
It is composed with such 5 courses,
1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects
4. Convolutional Neural Networks
5. Sequence Models
Flowing will be notes and erros which i made and correct through corresponding courses
## Neutral networks and deep learning

## Improving Deep Neural Networks
Three weeks needed to cover this course, initialization,gradient checking, and regulization 
are covered in the first week. Then week two introduce optimization function, followed with 
thrid week of tensorflow tutorial for a multi-class assignment.
Three ipynb notebook homework need to be coded.
* week 1,initialization,gradient checking and regulization
  * initialization
  Three initializaiton method is compared based on a data classification problem.
   1. Zeros initialization which basically  setting "zeros" in the input argument.
   2. Random initialization,the weights to large random values.
   3. He initialization 
  In the zeros initializaiton, loss function is barely learning with such weight as zeros, which 
  produce a barely learning line.
